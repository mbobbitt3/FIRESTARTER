MPERF is a cycle counter that increments at a specific, unchanging rate.  On
this process it is 3.6 billion times per second (3.6GHz).

APERF is a cycle counter that increments with the current clock frequency.

Sampling both counters at 1000 times a second will lead to a lot of variation
in the time between samples due to OS jitter.  But, since we're sampling
those two counters at roughly the same time (within the same ioctl call),
we can still figure out the average clock frequncy.  

MPERF[n+1] - MPERF[n] is the number of reference cycles between those two
particular samples.  Divide by 3.6 billion to get the number of seconds.

APERF[n+1] - APERF[n] is the number of actual CPU cycles between those
